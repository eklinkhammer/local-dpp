# local-dpp

Research code.

Implements D++ with local approximation. D++ is a reward shaping framework that utilizes counterfactuals to solve the credit assignment problem. This approach is trying to learn team oriented policies without having access to direct calculation of the global reward, but only an (agent specific) local approximation.
